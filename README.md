# breast-cancer-gene-expression-analysis
This code was developed as homework during the course of Bioquants in collaboration with Matteo Bianco. we analyzed a gene expression dataset with two phenotypes: breast cancer and normal. Two analysis are carried out: over-representation enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Results show differentially expressed genes between tumor and healthy patients are maily associated to cellular processes. Less correlation is found also with some diseases like COVID 19.
